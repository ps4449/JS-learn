<h1>Simon Game</h1>

Simon Says is a simple game that builds on memory.

In this game, there are four colours and infinite levels. In every level, a colour will flash. As the levels increases, the pattern of flashing colours will keep building. In every level, you have to repeat the pattern that you had created before, and add the new flashing colour to the pattern.

For example, in level 1, `yellow` flashes, so you click `yellow`.

In level 2, `blue` flashes, so you click `yellow` followed by `blue`. In level 3, `yellow` flashes, hence the pattern builds as follows:

Level 1: `yellow`<br>
Level 2: `yellow` -> `blue`<br>
Level 3: `yellow` -> `blue` -> `yellow`<br>

Similarly, the game will continue as long as you build the pattern correctly. If you miss a colour, you will have to restart the game.
